🎶 Raaganjali – Official Website

This is the official website for Raaganjali, a platform dedicated to Indian classical music and cultural performances.
I started this project on 4th August 2025 with the goal of creating a modern, responsive, and professional website to showcase Raaganjali’s events, gallery, and services.

🌐 Live Website: raaganjali-website.vercel.app

Raaganjali is more than a performance group — it’s a community and a celebration of music.

This website was built to:
Share Raaganjali’s mission and story
Highlight performances and services
Showcase an image gallery from past events
Keep visitors updated with upcoming events
Provide easy contact options and social links

🛠️ Tech Stack
This project was built using:
HTML5 – for the structure and content
CSS3 – for styling and responsiveness
